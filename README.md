# Pomodoro

### You set a timer for 25 minutes, work until it's up, then take a five-minute breakâ€”and repeat the whole process three more times. After that, you take a 15- to 30-minute break, depending on how you feel. And that's one full Pomodoro cycle.

- Ability to start a 25 minute session, to pause, reset and skip it
- Ability to continue the session with a 5 min break
- Ability to track a full 4 pomodoro cycle - and take a long break at the end of it

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

// Run command for local
npx tailwindcss -i ./src/index.css -o ./src/output.css --watch
